It is a spaceship game, bullethell style, where you can shoot and move around to dodge bullets and try to kill all the enemies.



What are all of the controls for the game?  What do I need to do to find/test every part of the game?
WASD or D-pad to move player, mouse to aim and mouse left button to shoot. Survive the waves of enemies until the boss spawns, then beat the boss.



What bugs or other problems are present?
We haven't found any bugs in the game.



Did you use any outside libraries?  If so, what are they, what are you using them for, and did you get permission from me?
No outside libraries.



Did you use any outside code?  This should include any code you did not write yourself.  
You will not receive a penalty if you did so, but you will not get credit for the outside code.  
If you have included outside code without reporting it honestly, it becomes a case of academic dishonesty.
No outside code used.
